                <ul>
                    <li>Go easy on the gas and brakes</li>
                    <p>driving efficiently can help to reduce emissions. Drive “like you have an egg under your foot,” recommends Brian West, an expert in fuel and engine research from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which researches energy use and solutions in the United States.</p>
                    <li>Regularly service your car</li>
                    <p>to keep it more efficient</p>
                    <li>Check your tires</li>
                    <p>Keeping tires pumped correctly can reduce emissions. “Low tire pressure will hurt your fuel economy,” Mr. West said.</p>
                    <li>Air conditioning and intensive city driving</li>
                    <p>can make emissions creep up. Cut down on these as often as possible</p>
                    <li>Use cruise control</li>
                    <p>on long drives — in most cases, this can help to save gas</p>
                    <li>Don’t weigh your car down</li>
                    <p>with extra things that you don’t need on your trip</p>
                    <li>Carpool</li>
                    <p>this way, you’re splitting emissions between the number of people in the car</p>
                    <li>fly less</li>
                    <p>Fly often? Taking one fewer long round-trip flight could shrink your personal carbon footprint significantly. Think about it this way: If you use public transportation often, and fly home to visit family just occasionally, your carbon footprint might still be relatively sustainable, but if you drive and fly a lot, your emissions will be higher.</p>
                    <p>If you can’t avoid flying, one way of making up for the emissions caused is to offset them by donating money to sustainable projects, such as supplying efficient stoves to rural homes, or projects which help farmers in India sell crop waste as biomass. Sometimes airlines will give you this option themselves, or you can use a third-party like Atmosfair or Terrapass.</p>
                    <li>Eat Less Meat</li>
                    <p>While food systems are complicated, and research is still evolving on what the most environmentally-friendly diet is, experts mostly agree that cutting down on meat, and red meat in particular, is a better choice for the environment. This is because the production of red meat uses a lot of feed, water and land. Cows themselves also give off methane emissions (a harmful greenhouse gas)</p>
                    <li>Heat, Lights and Appliances</li>
                    <p>In the average American home, 25 percent of energy is used to heat spaces, 13 percent is used to heat water, 11 percent is used for cooling and the remainder is spent on appliances, according to estimates from the Natural Resources Defense Council. Making even small changes to these can make a big difference, said Noah Horowitz, a senior scientist and director of the N.R.D.C.’s Center for Energy Efficiency. “There’s a lot you can do without having to pick up a hammer or write a check,” he said.</p>
